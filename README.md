`whosonfirst-www-iamhere` is a small web application for displaying coordinates based on the position of the map. Plus Who's on First data, optionally.

## Usage

### start.py - aka "fancy" mode in disguise

Run the `bin/start.py` command from the command line. This will start all the pieces needed to run `whosonfirst-www-iamhere` in "fancy" mode (which is [described in detail](https://github.com/whosonfirst/whosonfirst-www-iamhere/tree/master#fancy-mode) below.

Using `start.py` will require a few things that are outside the scope of this document:

1. That you know what the command line is and are comfortable using it.
2. That you have a copy of Python installed on your computer. If you are using Linux or a Mac it comes pre-installed.
3. That you have "checked out" a copy of the [whosonfirst-data](git@github.com:whosonfirst/whosonfirst-data.git) to your computer.

Okay, once that's all done this is all you should need to do to get started is type the following from the command line:

```
./bin/start.py -d /path/to/your/whosonfirst-data/data /path/to/your/whosonfirst-data/meta/wof-neighbourhood-latest.csv /path/to/your/whosonfirst-data/meta/wof-locality-latest.csv
```

_You can pass as many "meta" files as you want. Each record in each each meta file will be indexed and be query-able by `whosonfirst-www-iamhere`._

You will start to see a lot of logging sent to your terminal as the point-in-polygon server indexes your Who's On First data. Depending on how many meta files you've chosen to index and how many records they contain (and what kind of computer you're using) this process can take between 30 seconds and a couple minutes to complete.

Once it's finished point your web browser to `http://localhost:8001/` and start looking around!

### "simple" mode

There is one thing you need to run `whosonfirst-www-iamhere` locally in "simple" mode. Simple mode just means a map with live-updating information about its position.

* An HTTP file server for the `whosonfirst-www-iamhere` itself. This is because some browsers are super conservative about what can and can't run on `localhost` (aka your local machine) and what can be served from a `file://` URL (aka your hard drive) the [tangram.js](https://github.com/tangrams/tangram) maps need to be "served" from an actual web server. A very simple HTTP file server is included in this repository and discussed more in detail below.

### "simple" mode - is a little less simple

Surprise! There is also a second moving piece, which is a local (Javascript) settings file that you will need to configure by hand. Conveniently there is a sample versions which can simply rename if you want to use all the default settings.

### "fancy" mode

There are four separate components to running `whosonfirst-www-iamhere` locally in "fancy" mode. Fancy mode means a map with live-updating information about its position that will reverse-geocode those coordinates and display their corresponding Who's On First polygons. Optionally, you can also enable searching for a specific place using the [Mapzen Search API](https://mapzen.com/projects/search).

They are:

* An HTTP file server for the `whosonfirst-www-iamhere` itself. This is because some browsers are super conservative about what can and can't run on `localhost` (aka your local machine) and what can be served from a `file://` URL (aka your hard drive) the [tangram.js](https://github.com/tangrams/tangram) maps need to be "served" from an actual web server.  _This is discussed further below._

* An HTTP file server (that can set `CORS` headers) for the serving Who's On First data. _This is discussed further below._

* The [go-whosonfirst-pip](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-pip) point-in-polygon server used to query the data.  _This is discussed further below._

* A copy of the [whosonfirst-data](https://github.com/whosonfirst/whosonfirst-data) repository. You don't actually need all of the data. You just need all of the files listed in the CSV file(s) that the point-in-polygon server needs to load in folder organized in the standard Who's On First `123/456/7/1234567.geojson` tree structure.

### Running locally - the details

#### mapzen.whosonfirst.config.js

In the `www/javascript` folder there is a file called `mapzen.whosonfirst.config.js.example`. Make a copy of it called `mapzen.whosonfirst.config.js`. That's it. Unless you need or want to tailor anything to your needs. Available knobs include:

* Specifying a different endpoint for the point-in-polygon server
* Specifying a different endpoint for the Who's on First data server
* Specifying a [Pelias API key](https://mapzen.com/projects/search) if you want to enabled geocoding
* Specifying a different endpoint for the Pelias (Mapzen Search) API (for example if you're running your own instance)
* Toggling whether or not to display verbose logging in the web application

The `mapzen.whosonfirst.config.js` file is explicitly excluded from being checked-in to the `whosonfirst-www-iamhere` repository.

#### wof-pip-server

This is a small application written in the `Go` programming language that exposes point-in-polygon functionality over an HTTP API and is part of the [go-whosonfirst-pip](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-pip/) repository. Pre-compiled binary versions of `wof-pip-server` are available for three operating systems (OS X, Linux and Windows) in the [bin](bin) directory.

```
$> ./bin/osx/wof-pip-server -port 8080 -cors -data /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/data /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/meta/wof-neighbourhood-latest.csv /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/meta/wof-marinearea-latest.csv 
```

By default everything in this repository assumes the point-in-polygon server is running on port `8080`. If you change that you will need to update the `mapzen.whosonfirst.pip.endpoint` setting in config file, described below.

#### data server

This can be anything you want it to be, really, just as long as the data is returned with the `CORS` headers enabled.

We have written a small HTTP-based static webserver in the `Go` programming language called `wof-fileserver` that is part of the [go-whosonfirst-fileserver](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-fileserver) repository. Pre-compiled binary versions of `wof-fileservers` are available for three operating systems (OS X, Linux and Windows) in the [bin](bin) directory.

```
$> ./bin/osx/wof-fileserver -port 9999 -path /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/data/ -cors
```

By default everything in this repository assumes the data server is running on port `9999`. If you change that you will need to update the `mapzen.whosonfirst.data.endpoint` setting in config file, described below.

#### file server

This can be anything you want it to be. (It doesn't even have to set `CORS` headers.) We have written a small HTTP-based static webserver in the `Go` programming language called `wof-fileserver` that is part of the [go-whosonfirst-fileserver](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-fileserver) repository.  Pre-compiled binary versions of `wof-fileservers` are available for three operating systems (OS X, Linux and Windows) in the [bin](bin) directory.

```
$> ./bin/osx/wof-fileserver -port 8001 -path /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-www-iamhere/www/
```

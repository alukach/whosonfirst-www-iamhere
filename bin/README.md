# bin

## iamhere-server

A tiny little web server (written in Python) is included in the `bin` directrory that is configured to serve static files from the `www` directory (in this repository).

You should treat this web server as a toy. Anecdotally it is also very finnicky. It is included in order to try and minimize the number of _other things_ you need to install on your computer in order to get the examples working. Not everyone has Python installed on their computers by default but many do. Personally I prefer [go-whosonfirst-fileserver](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-fileserver) but unless you're confortable with yet-another language (Go) and build process you probably don't want to go there.
